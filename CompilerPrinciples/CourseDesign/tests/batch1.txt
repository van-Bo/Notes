#                  Compiler Principle - Test Suite
# ==============================================================================
#
# This file demonstrates the two modes of the test runner:
#
# 1. Self-Assessment Mode:
#    Lines ending with `// expect: <value>` or `// expect: error` are treated
#    as formal test cases. The result will be checked, and it will be
#    counted in the final PASS/FAIL summary.
#
# 2. Normal Calculator Mode:
#    Lines WITHOUT an `// expect:` tag are treated as simple expressions to
#    be calculated. The result will be displayed, but it will NOT be
#    counted in the test summary. This is useful for quick, one-off calculations.

# --- Basic Arithmetic & Precedence ---
10 + 2 * 6      // expect: 22
(10 + 2) * 6    // expect: 72
100 / 10 / 2    // expect: 5
10 - 2 - 3      // expect: 5
-5 * (-2 + 1)   // expect: 5

# --- Logic and Shift Operations ---
8 >> 1 + 2      // expect: 1
(8 >> 1) + 2    // expect: 6
10 | 3 & 5      // expect: 11
(10 | 3) & 5    // expect: 1
255 & 15 << 1   // expect: 30

# --- Mixed Base Numbers ---
0xFF + 0b1010   // expect: 265
100 * 0x10      // expect: 1600

# --- Deliberate Errors for Testing ---
10 / 0          // expect: error
5 * ( 2 + 3     // expect: error
10 & & 5        // expect: error
@ + 1           // expect: error
10 +            // expect: error
